/*
The security vulnerability in the code snippet is that the temporary file is not deleted securely. The fs.unlink() function only deletes the file from the filesystem. However, if an attacker has access to the filesystem, they could still access the contents of the file.

To fix this vulnerability, you can use the fs.unlinkSync() function. This function deletes the file from the filesystem and also removes any hard links to the file. This will make it more difficult for an attacker to access the contents of the file.

Another way to fix the vulnerability is to use a secure temporary file location. This could be a directory that is only accessible to the web application or the web server. This would prevent an attacker from accessing the temporary file even if they have access to the filesystem. */
